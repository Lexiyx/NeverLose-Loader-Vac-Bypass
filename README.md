# NeverLose-Loader-Vac-Bypass

I tried to copy the NeverLose loader. I actually got this file from iHome but it had a few bugs I fixed them and now Im sharing it here. In fact he acts as an injector and he also uses the Manual Map Inject method. If you want you can use this file as a Loader in a Future Trick because it looks stylish lol.     this.guna2CirclePictureBox1.ShadowDecoration.Mode = Guna.UI2.WinForms.Enums.ShadowMode.Circle;     There is a bug in this code and you need to fix it.

And it works with Loader Guna UI. 
Also This Loader There is also Memory Protection in.
